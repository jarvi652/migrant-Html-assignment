                    Hello and welcome to my page. As Harvard medical school suggests:<a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/topics/healthy-eating#:~:text=There%20are%20no%20single%20nutrients,beans%2C%20nuts%2C%20and%20seeds."> <cite>An important take-home message is to focus on the types of foods you eat and your overall dietary pattern, instead of on individual nutrients such as fat, dietary cholesterol, or specific vitamins.</cite></a>
                    Confused about what constitutes a healthy diet? <br> You aren't alone. Over the years, what seemed to be flip flops from medical research combined with the <br>flood of diet books and diet plans based on little or no science have muddied the water. But a consensus has emerged about the basics, which are really pretty simple.
                    An important take-home message is to <br>focus on the types of foods you eat and your overall dietary pattern, instead of on individual nutrients <br>such as fat, dietary cholesterol, or specific vitamins. There are no single nutrients or vitamins that can <br>make you healthy. Instead, there is a short list of key food types that together can dramatically reduce <br>your risk for heart disease.
                    <blockquote cite="https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/5-tips-to-help-you-stay-healthy-this-winter"><p style='word-break: break-all; font-size:large'>To stay healthy this winter, people should stick to tried-and-true infection-control strategies, such as handwashing, following a healthy lifestyle, having regular medical check-ups, and getting a flu shot and other recommended vaccines.</p></blockquote>
